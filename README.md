- 👋 Hi, I’m Kelly.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python at the moment. I do want to learn at least surface level knowledge of other coding/programming languages. I'm a beginner at all of this and have no formal study.
- 🌱 We're currently practicing JavaScript and Bootstrap 4.
- 💞️ Any help is greatly appreciated
